<h3><u>Cons of the current designs:</u></h3>
<p>•	too many buttons are present on the dashboard hence making it confusing for the user .<br>
•	position of the meters are not in the eyeline of the driver. therfore, it can be dangerous to keep an eye on the meters for warning signs during driving. <br>
•	Use of analog meters makes it hard to read for the new users to understand.<br>
•	Different screens are used for different meters like speedometer, tachometer and other warning signs.
 <br>
• Occupies a lot of space and ruins the look of the interior of the car.<br>
• User cannot get the exact values of speed and rpm because of the use of analog meter.
<h2>Answers for B:</h2>

<p>•Tracking total distance covered <br>
•	Checking battery alerts<br>
•	Seat belt signs<br>
•	Tracking washer fluid <br>
•	Checking air bag indecator<br><br>

<h3><u>Comman Mistakes in current design:</h3></u>
<p>In the current design of the dashboard, the biggest drawback is that due to use of analog speedometer and tachometer it becomes hard fpr user to read the readings on the meter.<br>
    The position of the speedometer and other meters on the dashborad are not in the eyeline of the user thus it can be dangerous to look at the dashboard while driving because the driver has to take eyes off the road to see the meters.<br>
 The current design has a lot of different screens and buttons which make it a bad design.   </p>



<h3><u>My design sketch to overcome the above mentioned mistakes: </h3></u>
<img src="11.jpg" alt="Design Sketch" width="800" height="600">
<p>

<h3><u>Key feature of my design:</u></h3>
1.	the analog meters are replaced by the digital meters so that the user can get the exact values of speed and rpm.<br>
2.	All the functions are on single sceen and are in the eyeline of the driver hence is less dangerous to keep an eye oin the functions.<br>
3.	The dashboard has all the warn ing signs that are crucial for the car like engine temp., oul pressure etc.<br>
4.	The dashboard also shows the outside temperature.<br>
5.	There are no buttons on the dashboard which eleminates all the confusion that was caused by the huge number of buttons in the previous design.<br>
