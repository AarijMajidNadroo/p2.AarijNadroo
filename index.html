<h3><u>Comman Mistakes in current design:</h3></u>
<p>In the current design of the dashboard, the biggest drawback is that due to use of analog speedometer and tachometer it becomes hard fpr user to read the readings on the meter.<br>
    The position of the speedometer and other meters on the dashborad are not in the eyeline of the user thus it can be dangerous to look at the dashboard while driving because the driver has to take eyes off the road to see the meters.<br>
 The current design has a lot of different screens and buttons which make it a bad design.   </p>



<h3><u>My design sketch to overcome the above mentioned mistakes: </h3></u>
<img src="11.jpg" alt="Design Sketch" width="800" height="600">
<p>

<h3><u>Key feature of my design:</u></h3>
1.	Has a properly visible button placed on the handle to open the door.<br>
2.	Has simple function button to operate. The user does not need to memorize any codes for any function.<br>
3.	Proper indication present on the display to differentiate clock time and microwave timer.<br>
4.	The display also has some additional information like a separate icon for each function. The icon glows when the respective function is running.<br>
5.	The microwave interface has proper naming and indication for every button. The interface also includes Braille Scripted Name for every function for visually impaired users.<br>
6.	The presence of icons on the interface for every function makes it easy to use for old aged people and children who find it difficult to read the small font of the text.  <br>
